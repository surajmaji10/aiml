### 📍 Year End Marks: 2024
📆 With this, we come to an end to __2024__.\
🏳️ Many new things were achieved in this year.\
🙏 I am thankful to all those who helped me reach here.\
🙌 Now it's time to gear up for __2025__.

<!-- truncate -->
💻 We will start learning **AI/ML/DS** in this year.\
😃 It will be *self-paced* and *self-supported*.

📒 The active repository will be maintained at:\
GitHub: [Here](https://github.com/surajmaji10/AI-ML-DS/tree/main)

### Why AI/ML/DS ?
Simple answer: it is the need and trend of the hour.\

### How will we move ahead?
We will start from very scratch. I do not know ML myself. But I will teach myself.
I will try to document my journey, in the form of these blogs. I will keep posting online resources for reference.

Most of the things we will see will include free resources and materials from places like `YouTube`, `Google`, and others.
