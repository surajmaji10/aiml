## 📆 DAY-001 | Jan 1st, 2025 🙌
We will begin studying Python.
First, we learn pandas, a tool widely used in the data science community.
<!-- truncate -->

### Pandas:
`pandas` is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.\
For more info, visit: [Pandas Link](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Python Link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Why we begin with `pandas`?
There is no simple or difficult reason.\
We will have to learn different tools like `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` and more.
The choice is arbitrary. With that said, we will also learn more on `python`
in futures posts.

### 📜Steps to get started?
1. Install python and pandas.
```bash
sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install python
pip install pandas
```
2. Create a directory and create python files(.py and .ipynb)
3. Start learning in an IDE or Jupyter Notebook

### ✒️Note: 
- You can use VSCode(please use this, great support and extensions). Visit [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Please use `anaconda` or `miniconda` for Jupyter and other related tools. Just skip the registration process. Visit [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).

PS: We know there are many online tutorials online that will help you to setup these tools. Please refer them as per your system and platform.
